# mastermind

This deals with a game known as Mastermind: https://www.cs.uni.edu/~wallingf/teaching/cs3530/resources/knuth-mastermind.pdf.
The code originally has a length of 4 and each element can take 6 possible values.
I will consider a general case in which the length and the number of symbols can have differnet values (in any case greater than 0).
